# bglugwatch-binaries
OS binaries for BGLUGwatch

# How to use?
Simply execute the binary file.

# What are the pros?
- easier to use
- easier to distribute 
- you no need install python to use them

# Cons?
- updates slower (i don't have the time to maintain them)
- larger files
- not all platforms supported (yet!)*

`*` But you can help with this! Install pip3, run `pip3 install pyinstaller`, and run `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed bglug.py` and then PR it! Thanks! :)
